# Governance

This policy ensures the **User Journey Graph (UJG)** spec is developed with transparency and technical integrity.

### Key Roles

- **Editors/Maintainers:** Steward the process, merge PRs, and ensure cross-module coherence.
- **Contributors:** Anyone submitting text, code, or feedback.

### How Work Happens

- **Decision Making:** Based on **rough consensus**. If a stalemate occurs, Editors make a documented final call.
- **Change Classes:** \* _Editorial:_ Minor fixes; merged quickly.
- _Normative:_ Changes requirements; requires an issue and full review.
- _Breaking:_ Only allowed in **Editor’s Drafts**; never in existing snapshots.

### Publication Model

- **Editor’s Draft (ED):** The live, evolving workspace (`/ed/`).
- **Technical Reports (TR):** Frozen, immutable snapshots (`/TR/version/`) for stable implementation.

### Core Principles

- **Interoperability First:** Core Graph and Serialization rules always override individual modules.
- **Privacy by Design:** All example data must be synthetic; PII is strictly discouraged.
- **Conduct:** Respectful collaboration is mandatory.
